# ChopNow Fullstack Implementation Report

## Project Overview

ChopNow is a comprehensive food rescue platform designed to reduce food waste by connecting users with vendors offering surplus food at discounted prices. The platform includes mobile and web applications with features such as:

- User authentication and profile management
- Marketplace for browsing and purchasing surprise bags
- Vendor dashboard for managing inventory
- Blockchain-based payments and loyalty system
- AI-powered recommendation engine
- Community feed and educational content
- Impact tracking and reporting
- Admin panel for platform management

## Architecture

The solution follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Applications**
   - Web application (React, TypeScript, Material UI)
   - Admin panel (React, TypeScript, Material UI)

2. **Backend Services**
   - API service (Node.js, Express)
   - Recommendation engine (Python, FastAPI)
   - Blockchain service (Node.js, Stellar SDK, Soroban)

3. **Infrastructure**
   - PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
   - Redis for caching and session management
   - Docker containers for all services
   - CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: UI Implementation

The UI was built with React and TypeScript, following a mobile-first responsive design approach. Key features include:

- Clean, modern interface with green/white color scheme
- Card-based layouts for food items and vendors
- Responsive design that works across all device sizes
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance

### Phase 2: Blockchain & Subscription

The blockchain integration leverages the Stellar network and Soroban smart contracts:

- **Stellar Payments**: Secure cryptocurrency transactions for purchasing surprise bags
- **Soroban Smart Contracts**:
  - Escrow contract for secure order processing
  - Loyalty token contract for the "Green Saver Pass" subscription system
  - Impact tracking contract for measuring environmental benefits
- **Green Saver Pass**: Tiered subscription system (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) with loyalty points and benefits

### Phase 3: AI & Community

The AI and community features enhance user engagement and personalization:

- **Recommendation Engine**: Python-based service using collaborative and content-based filtering
- **Community Feed**: Social platform for sharing recipes, tips, and success stories
- **Notification System**: Comprehensive system for push, email, and SMS notifications
- **Educational Content**: Resources on food waste reduction and sustainable practices

### Phase 4: Admin & Reporting

The admin and reporting tools provide platform management capabilities:

- **Admin Panel**: Complete dashboard for user, vendor, order, and content management
- **Impact Metrics**: Visualization of environmental impact (CO2 reduced, water saved, meals rescued)
- **Reporting Tools**: Exportable reports for business intelligence
- **Content Moderation**: Tools for managing community content

## Deployment

The solution is containerized using Docker and can be deployed using the provided docker-compose configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: ./apps/web
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
    
  admin:
    build: ./apps/admin
    ports: ["3001:3000"]
    
  api:
    build: ./apps/api
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
    
  recommendation:
    build: ./apps/recommendation
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
    
  blockchain:
    build: ./packages/blockchain
    ports: ["9000:9000"]
    
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    
  redis:
    image: redis:7
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance

The codebase includes comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: For service interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: For complete user flows

The CI/CD pipeline automatically runs these tests on every code change to ensure quality and stability.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose
3. Run `docker-compose up` from the project root
4. Access the web application at http://localhost:3000
